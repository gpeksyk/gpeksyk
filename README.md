- 👋 Hi, I’m @gpeksyk but feel free to call me by my name - Gregory.
- 👀 I’m interested in software testing and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python in terms of software testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could help me develop basic skills both written in Java and Python.
      I would also like to contribute to various projects which need testing, to improve quality of the product.
